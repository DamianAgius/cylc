<!--l. 673--><p class="indent" >   The problem with the word &#8220;cycle&#8221; is that it is often used to refer to a series of times (e.g. &#8220;an hourly cycle&#8221;) as
well as a particular time (e.g. &#8220;current cycle&#8221; or &#8220;current cycle point&#8221;). Here, we use &#8220;cycle point&#8221; to refer to a
particular (usually date-time) item. If a task has an hourly date-time cycle that starts at 2014-01-01T00 and ends at
2014-01-02T00, the first &#8220;cycle point&#8221; will be 2014-01-01T01, the second &#8220;cycle point&#8221; will be 2014-01-01T02,
etc.
<!--l. 681--><p class="indent" >   You may be accustomed to the idea that a forecasting suite has a &#8220;current cycle&#8221; (our nomenclature: &#8220;current
cycle point&#8221;), which is typically the analysis time or nominal start time of the main forecast model(s) in the suite,
and that the whole suite advances to the next forecast cycle point when all tasks in the current cycle point have
finished (or even when a particular wall clock time is reached, in real time operation). As explained in the
Introduction, this is not how cylc works.
<!--l. 689--><p class="indent" >   Cylc suites advance by means of individual tasks with private cycle points (times) independently spawning
successors at the next valid cycle point for the task, not by incrementing a suite-wide forecast cycle point. Each task
will be submitted when its own prerequisites are satisfied, regardless of other tasks with other cycle points running,
or not, at the time. It may still be convenient at times, however, to refer to the &#8220;current cycle point&#8221;, the &#8220;previous
cycle point&#8221;, or the &#8220;next cycle point&#8221; and so forth, with reference to a particular task, or in the sense of all tasks
that &#8220;belong to&#8221; a particular forecast cycle point. But keep in mind that the members of these groups
may not be present simultaneously in the running suite - i.e.&#x00A0;different tasks may pass through the
&#8220;current cycle point&#8221; (etc.) at different times as the suite evolves, particularly in delayed (catch up)
operation.
